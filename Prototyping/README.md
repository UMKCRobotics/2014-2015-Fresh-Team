Prototyping Sketchbook
--------------------

This directory is for Arduino code used for the prototype robot or Arduino code
that is being tested standalone from the main robot software. Since Arduino 
sketches require their own folder for use from the default ide and tools it 
should keep the main Arduino directory and the repo's root directory cleaner.
